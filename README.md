Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Description:
In this project I have created Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. Analyzed a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. Done Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.

House price prediction is the process of using data to estimate the value of a house. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to determine the value of a home for sale, to assess the risk of a mortgage, or to make investment decisions. There are a variety of different methods that can be used to predict house prices. Some of the most common methods include:

Linear regression: This is a simple method that uses a straight line to predict the value of a house.
